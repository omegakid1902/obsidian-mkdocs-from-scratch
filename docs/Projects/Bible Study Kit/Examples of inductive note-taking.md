# Examples of inductive note-taking
When we [[Start connecting Scripture]] we can connect in two ways: Inductively or deductively. This outlines *inductive* note-taking from Scripture. Have a look at [[Examples of deductive note-taking]]. 

Both are forms of [[Connected Biblical Thinking]] and means to live a [[God-centered life]].

This process can happen on different layers of structure: Verse, Chapter, Book and on Scripture as a whole.

## Verse
Let's say I meditate on [[John-03]]. What stands out to me is verse 35:

![[John-03#v35]]

This reminds me of the note I have on [[Split Thinking]] and how not only some things are under the authority of Jesus but *all things*. I add a new heading: [[Split Thinking#All things are under Jesus' authority]].

## Chapter
In a similar way, whole chapters can speak to us and warrant a new note. Upon reading [[Gen-01]], we see that there is so much to draw out. In the newly created note [[Creation account]], we consolidate our thoughts and prepare the ground for an evergreen note that can continue to grow with us as our insights grow.

## Book
Each book of [[The Bible]] has it's own note. While reading though a book we can use it to write down the themes of the book or sketch an outline. See [[John]] for an example.

## Scripture
The Bible is one unified ([[Luke-24#v27]]) , God-breathed ([[2 Tim-03#v16]]) story pointing towards Jesus. In a note like [[God's unified story]] we can keep track of the meta-narrative and view whatever we are reading in God's grand story.

### Biblical motifs
Similarly, the Bible is written in a densely connected way (See: [[Connecting strengthens remembering]]). There are repeating motifs and images that expand and are re-contextualized as we keep reading. In a note like [[Biblical Themes and Images MOC]] we can keep track of each theme and it's occurrences and relevance.

### What does this remind me of?
Almost everything that Jesus says or does is a reference to other parts of Scripture. Let's take the story of [[Mark-04#v39]] for example. Think about the key elements and ask yourself "Where have I seen this before?" There's a boat, on water, a storm, someone is sleeping in the boat while other people are panicking.

There is a huge value in reading the Bible keeping similar stories in mind.
