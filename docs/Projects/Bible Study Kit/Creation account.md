## We see God at work
### God is drawing joy from his labour
[[Gen-01#v31|God saw it was good]]. After a day of full work, God saw what he accomplished, he sits back in his chair and draws joy from his creation. It is the sense of fulfillment you get from something that you love and that you're good at.

### The biblical perspective of work is unique from other creation stories
In most ancient creation stories, humans were created to *outsource* the work of gods. In the "Euma Elish" creation story from Babylon, the gods are tired of work and complain to Marduk, the king of the gods. This is his plan:

> I will establish a savage
> "Man" shall be his name …
> He shall be charged with the service of the gods,
> that they might be at ease.

In most stories work is a burden, something below the gods. In the biblical creation narrative, the Creator God actually *enjoys* work. Humans aren't created to be cheap servants, providing the work but are called into a *special partnership with God* as Image bearers.
