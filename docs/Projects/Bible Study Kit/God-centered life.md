# God-centered life

## Lists of priorities are a form of split thinking
Making a list of priorities about what matters most to us in life seems like a smart thing to do. An issue we often run into though is that this can present a form of [[Split Thinking]], ie. compartmentalization. My first priority is God, next comes my marriage, then my health third, etc. But this begs the question, "How much is enough?" When did I fulfill my "God quota"? When can I "move on" from the God part of my day and start worrying about my wife?

## Quiet Time is not enough
It sounds absurd when I put it like this but I certainly fall into this trap sometimes. Of course *all* of my decisions affect my wife. Even more, living with Jesus isn't about checking the "Time with God"-box in the morning and then moving on. Life with Jesus is *always* abiding in the vine ([[John-15#v4]]). Through my whole day. In *everything*.

## God at the center of my life
As the sun is central to the solar system and shines into everything, so I want God to be the center of my life. I want him to shine into everything, every interest, every relationship, every academic curiosity. Every thing I do needs to be influenced by God, the center of my life.

Just as Jesus did nothing on his own ([[John-08#v28]]) I want every area of my life to point to him. 

A way of doing this is the practice of [[Connected Biblical Thinking]].
