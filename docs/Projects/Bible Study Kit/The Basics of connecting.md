links: [[Start connecting Scripture]]
# The Basics of connecting
You can connect Scripture in three ways: Linking, embedding and back links.

## Linking
This is the very fabric of practicing [[Connected Biblical Thinking]] and reaping the [[Benefits of Connected Biblical Thinking]].

As you would link any other note, establish a link to a specific verse using the `[[]]` syntax and then hitting `#` (for a link to a header) and reference the verse. Example: [[Gen-01#v1]].

You can also set a display text, using the pipe (`|`): [[Gen-01#v1|In the beginning]]

## Embedding
Embed a verse (or chapter) by prefacing it with `!` as such:

![[Prov-02#v6]]

Using various [[CSS tweaks]], you can prettify the embed.

## Back links
Open these two scriptures in a new note: [[Gen-01#v1]] and [[Prov-02#v6]].

In the right hand panel, you can see all notes in which those passages are linked. This is a real game changer. Now, whenever you open a passage, you can see all of your thoughts on it! It's like margin notes on steroids.

As you can see here, [[Connecting simplifies retrieving]].
