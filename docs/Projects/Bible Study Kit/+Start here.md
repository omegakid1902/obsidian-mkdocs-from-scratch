# Start here
Welcome to the Bible Study Kit, nice to meet you! üëã If you're curious about who I am, you can read a bit more [[About me]]. If you accidentally stumbled upon this kit and have no idea about the Biblical story, start here: [[What is the Gospel|What is the Gospel?]].

## Common shortcomings of acquiring knowledge
Meditating on the Word is the core of being a disciple of Jesus. The Bible exhorts us to "acquire and seek knowledge" ([[Prov-18#v15]]). Yet, the way in which we do that is often inefficient. You can probably identify with some of [[The shortcomings of common note-taking practices]]. 

## Dive into the kit
After you have identified some of the challenges you're facing, you're ready to dive in. When lost, you can always come back to the [[+Overview|Overview]].

You can navigate for- and backward with those hotkeys: `Option + ‚Üí` and `Option + ‚Üê`.

There are three paths which you can explore:
