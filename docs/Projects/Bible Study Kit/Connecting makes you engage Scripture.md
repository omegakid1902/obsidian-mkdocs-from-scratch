# Connecting makes you engage Scripture
This is the game-changer. In connecting our Study notes we are forced to **evaluate every thought against the backdrop of Scripture**. This makes us engage with Scripture in a holistic way.

This gets even more powerful when we use Obsidian not only for Bible Study but for all of our [[020 Interests MOC|Interests]]. The framework of connecting every thing sets the stage for living a [[God-centered life]]. Now [[Connected Biblical Thinking]] does not merely become an organization tool but a *discipleship tool*.

I am curious about a vast array of topics â€“ each in my [[020 Interests MOC|Interests]]. Since each of the notes on my interests co-exists in a database with the library of Scripture, I am forced to engage with Scripture, asking it, with the guidance of the Holy Spirit, on it's perspective. 

My notes grow from stenciled theology into a living organism. Every thought is interacting with the God-inspired Word. I am more and more centering my life around Christ.
