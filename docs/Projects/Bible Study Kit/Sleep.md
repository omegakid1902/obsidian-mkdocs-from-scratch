# Sleep MOC: Commentary
As an example how to engage topics with [[Connected Biblical Thinking]], I will outline stages of MOC creation and adaption below:

## Stage 1
I was reading a book on sleep and very convinced about the importance of it. I added one of the created notes in a MOC:
***
### Sleep MOC
* [[The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life]]
***

## Stage 2
In this MOC there is no connection to Scripture. That is fine initially. I would jot down ideas, test them and see how they fit into a [[God-centered life]]. 

The first Bible verse that comes to my mind on the importance of Sleep is [[1 Cor-06#v19]]. We are called to steward our body. I would add that into the MOC:
***
### Sleep MOC
* We are called to steward our body well: [[1 Cor-06#v19]]
* [[The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life]]
***
## Stage 3
After a couple of days of making sleep a big priority in my life, I noticed a tension. Making sleep increasingly important in my life would sometimes come at the cost of relationships.

After some consideration, I might stumble upon the story in the gospels where Jesus, fully at peace in the Father's presence, was awakened during a storm by the frightened disciples: [[Mark-04#v39]]. In love, Jesus forwent sleep to calm the storm and address to worries of his disciples.

I add important nuance into the MOC:
***
### Sleep MOC
* We are called to steward our body well: [[1 Cor-06#v19]]
* [[The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life]]
* At times, forgoing sleep in order to love people is more important: [[Mark-04#v39]].
