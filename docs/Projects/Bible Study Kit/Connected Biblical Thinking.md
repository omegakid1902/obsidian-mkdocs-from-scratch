# Connected Biblical Thinking
This is an umbrella term I use for engaging with Scripture in a context of note-taking (or: *Personal Knowledge Management â€“ PKM*).

My personal flavor of organising my notes is "Linking your thinking", an adaptation of the tried and true practice of "Zettelkasten", which was pioneered by [[nickmilo]]. A great starting point into the whole method is Nick's [Beginner's Guide to Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd).

I have found that the wisdom in those note-making approaches works in a beautiful symbiosis with Scripture.

I am hoping to provide tools to unlock the [[Benefits of Connected Biblical Thinking]], especially the fact that [[Connecting makes you engage Scripture]], in order for my life to be transformed into more and more of a [[God-centered life]].

## A note on humility
I feel a strong discomfort around coining a term like "Connected Biblical thinking". I sound like a guru to myself. This method is not a product I am trying to market, nor necessarily something I came up with. It is something that works well for me, I can imagine it works for others and things need a name.

I simply want to share this: That there are tremendous benefits of meaningfully connecting Scripture to your study (and personal) notes (For more details, see [[Benefits of Connected Biblical Thinking]]). 

My hope is that in providing this kit more people would get to know God better through his word.
