# Start connecting Scripture
If you are unfamiliar with linking in Obsidian (or simply want a refresher), have a look at [[The Basics of connecting]].

Connecting is where the magic happens. This is where the [[Benefits of Connected Biblical Thinking]] come in and you move more towards a [[God-centered life]].

## How to connect
Connections to Scripture happen in to ways: *Inductive* and *deductive*. Here is the overview note: [[Examples of Connected Biblical Thinking]].

### Inductive Bible Study
This is where you read Scripture and *from* it create new notes or fill related ones with insight. It's "Scripture-Out" thinking.

This process can happen on different layers of structure: Verse, Chapter, Book and throughout Scripture. See the [[Examples of inductive note-taking]]

### Deductive Bible Study
This is where you engage with Scripture and connect *towards* it. It's "Toward-Scripture" thinking.

When working on a note on a topic that might or might not seems related, you start linking Scripture towards it. The core benefit is that [[Connecting makes you engage Scripture]]. 

You have a note on a specific thing you believe Scripture says? Now you are forced to actually go to the Text and evaluate your idea against what Scripture actually says. 

Even more powerfully, when you have a note in your digital mind, that *seems* unrelated to Scripture, you are forced to evaluate it: What does the Bible actually say about [[Note Example - Design|Design]]? What does it say about [[Sleep]]? What does it say about how much I let myself be discipled by Scripture when vast areas of my vault lack any connection to the Bible? 

This effortful engagement pushes us towards a [[God-centered life]] and when practiced prayerfully becomes a means of discipleship.

Have a look at some [[Examples of deductive note-taking]] to get an idea of how to implement it in your vault.
