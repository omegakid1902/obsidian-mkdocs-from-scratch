**1\. [_Pride and Prejudice_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/183689/pride-and-prejudice/9780141199078.html) by Jane Austen (1813)**

**We said:** It is a truth universally acknowledged that when most people think of [Jane Austen](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/11107/jane-austen.html) they think of this charming and humorous story of love, difficult families and the tricky task of finding a handsome husband with a good fortune.

**You said:** Philosophy, history, wit, and the most passionate love story.

**2\. [_To Kill a Mockingbird_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1088099/to-kill-a-mockingbird/9781784752637.html) by** **Harper Lee (1960)**

**We said:** A novel before its time, [Harper Lee](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1043380/harper-lee.html)’s Pulitzer-prize winner addresses issues of race, inequality and segregation with both levity and compassion. Told through the eyes of loveable rogues Scout and Jem, it also created one of literature’s most beloved heroes – Atticus Finch, a man determined to right the racial wrongs of the Deep South.

**You said:** A jarring & poignantly beautiful story about how humans treat each other.

Greygardens, Twitter

**3\. [_The Great Gatsby_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/56606/the-great-gatsby/9780141182636.html) by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)**

**We said:** Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire who throws decadent parties but doesn’t attend them, is one of the great characters of American literature. This is **_[F. Scott Fitzgerald](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1036771/f-scott-fitzgerald.html)_** at his most sparkling and devastating.

**You said:** The greatest, most scathing dissection of the hollowness at the heart of the American dream. Hypnotic, tragic, both of its time and completely relevant.

**4\. [_One Hundred Years of Solitude_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/56215/one-hundred-years-of-solitude/9780241968581.html) by Gabriel García Márquez (1967)**  

**We said:**  [Gabriel García Márquez](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/9183/gabriel-garcia-marquez.html)’s multi-generational spanning magnum opus was a landmark in Spanish literature.

**You said:** Magic realism at its best. Both funny and moving, this book made me reflect for weeks on the inexorable march of time.

**5\. [_In Cold Blood_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/57020/in-cold-blood/9780141182575.html) by Truman Capote (1965)**

**We said:** The ‘true crime’ TV show / podcast you’re obsessed with probably owes a debt to this masterpiece of reportage by [Truman Capote](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/19953/truman-capote.html). Chilling and brilliant.

**You said:** In this groundbreaking novel, completed after six arduous years of research, Capote invented a new genre - the 'Nonfiction Novel' - applying prose techniques to fact. It spawned the school of New Journalism & invented the true crime genre as we know it.

**6\. [_Wide Sargasso Sea_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/57281/wide-sargasso-sea/9780241281901.html) by Jean Rhys (1966)**

**We said:** [Jean Rhys](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/11345/jean-rhys.html) wrote this feminist and anti-colonial prequel to Charlotte Bronte’s novel _Jane Eyre_ which chronicles the events of Mr Rochester’s disastrous marriage to Antoinette Conway or Bertha as we come to know her.

**You said:** Rhys took a character from a classic novel and breathed new life into the “madwoman in the attic” based on her own experiences/world view. She beautifully showed how the stories we read fold into our lives to make new stories.

**7\. [_Brave New World_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1110001/brave-new-world/9781784870140.html) by Aldous Huxley (1932)**

**We said:** One of the greatest and most prescient dystopian novels ever written, this should be on everyone’s must-read list.

**You said:** Given the exponential growth of AI, Machine Learning & Robotics, Huxley's vision acts as a warning. Will we rise and challenge those who seek to shape our future or sleepwalk toward conditioning by technology?

David G, Twitter    

**8. _[I Capture The Castle](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/296874/i-capture-the-castle/9780141371504.html)_ by Dodie Smith (1948)**

**We said:** Cassandra Mortmain’s upbringing in a crumbling castle with her eccentric family may not be everyone’s experience, but we can guarantee her coming-of-age story with all its enchanting and disenchanting moments will resonate for many.

**You said:** A 'children's book' that speaks volumes (ha) about unrequited love and dysfunctional families. Timeless. And funny. (and we need some laughs on the 100 Classics list!)

Helen Y, Twitter

**9\. _[Jane Eyre](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/34231/jane-eyre/9780141040387.html)_ by Charlotte Bronte (1847)**

**We said:** One of literature’s steeliest heroines, in her short life Jane Eyre has overcome a traumatic childhood only to be challenged by secrets, strange noises and mysterious fires in her new home of Thornfield Hall. All while falling in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. A Gothic masterpiece which was groundbreaking in its intimate use of the first-person narrative.

**You said:** Because Jane is a role model: she stands up for herself, others and what she believes in, but isn't too proud to give second chances to those whose time is running out.

Sarah F, Twitter

**10\. [_Crime and Punishment_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/35469/crime-and-punishment/9780140449136.html) by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1866)**

**We said:** This novel is a masterful and completely captivating depiction of a man experiencing a profound mental unravelling. No amount of ethical bargaining on Raskolnikov’s part can free him from the parasitic guilt nested in his soul. A brilliant read if you loved _Breaking Bad_.

**You said:** No other novel has made me feel so much for the main characters, so deeply depicted by the author. I felt like an orphan when I finished it and it's the only novel I've re-read several times.

Angie V, Twitter

**11\. [_The Secret History_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/133251/the-secret-history/9780241982884.html) by Donna Tartt (1992)**

**We said:** [Donna Tartt](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/21632/donna-tartt.html)'s book follows a clique of smart, attractive students at an elite university, and an outsider who finds himself forced to conceal a dark secret. A gripping and tense read.

**You said**: A modern classic - so well-articulated and written (something that’s hard to come by these days). Also, EXCELLENT PLOT!

AnamiAndBooks, Twitter

**12.  [_The Call of the Wild_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/59518/the-call-of-the-wild/9780141321059.html) by Jack London (1903)**

**We said:** [Jack London](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/10760/jack-london.html) was a gold prospector in the Canadian wilderness and used his experiences to write about a dog named Buck who becomes a leader of the wild. With themes exploring nature and the struggle for existence in the frozen Alaskan landscape.

**You said:** Because everyone who loves the earth knows it’s true.

Helen D, Twitter

**13\. [_The Chrysalids_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/312527/the-chrysalids/9780141181479.html) by John Wyndham (1955)**  

**We said:** An allegoric dystopia written in the wake of the Second World War, _The Chrysalids_ cleverly strives to denounce acts of the past while including a profound plea for tolerance.

**You said:** A post-apocalyptic novel, about intolerance, loneliness, friendship, and what it means to be human. A fantastic sci-fi novel, as relevant today as it was in the 50s.

Hollie B, Twitter

**14\. [_Persuasion_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/55906/persuasion/9780141197692.html) by Jane Austen (1818)**

**We said:** Austen’s last completed novel before her untimely death was one tinged with heartache and regret. Anne Elliot’s feelings for the handsome Captain Wentworth are re-ignited when he returns from sea. Will they get a second chance at happiness? 

**You said:** This continues to be my favourite novel. It is a more mature love story, full of humourous, delightful observations of human behaviour. It offers us a glimpse of redemption. We change as we grow, and the mistakes made in our youth can be overcome.

Dartmouth\_Diva, Twitter

**15\. [_Moby-Dick_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/62240/moby-dick/9780142437247.html) by Herman Melville (1851)**

**We said:** Every American writer since 1851 has been chasing the same whale: to somehow write a novel as epic and influential as Melville’s.

**You said:** The great American novel: great characters, wonderful language, thick with the Bible and Thomas Browne, and has the best opening sentence ever. What's not to like?

David H, Twitter

 **16. _[T](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1100737/the-chronicles-of-narnia--the-lion--the-witch-and-the-wardrobe/9780563477389.html)[he Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1100737/the-chronicles-of-narnia--the-lion--the-witch-and-the-wardrobe/9780563477389.html)_ by C.S. Lewis (1950)**

**We said:** [C.S. Lewis](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1075072/c-s--lewis.html)’s timeless tale captured the hearts of children everywhere with its fantastical world through the wardrobe, full of fauns, dwarves and anthropomorphised animals. Whether you were Peter, Edmund, Susan or Lucy, we all wanted to put on a fur coat and go on a snow-laden adventure with Mr Tumnus.

**You said:** A beautiful timeless tale of innocence, wonder and sacrifice for young and old alike. It was one of the first books that I read from cover to cover without putting down!

Adisha K, Twitter  
 

**17\. [_To the Lighthouse_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/57101/to-the-lighthouse/9780241341681.html) by Virginia Woolf (1927)**

**We said:** _To the Lighthouse_ is a daring novel with little regard for rules. There’s no consistent narrator, scant dialogue and almost no plot. With everything stripped away, we’re left with a breathtaking and lyrical meditation on relationships, nature and the folly of perception.

**You said:** You feel like you’re stood on top of a cliff with the sea breeze blowing right through your bones.

Halcyonbookdays, Twitter  
 

**18\. _[The Death of the Heart](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1033043/the-death-of-the-heart/9780099276456.html)_ by Elizabeth Bowen (1938)**

**We said:** Considered [Elizabeth Bowen](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1012164/elizabeth-bowen.html)’s masterpiece novel, this is the story of 16-year old Portia who is sent to live with her Aunt in London, after her mother’s death. There, she falls for the attractive cad Eddie. A devastating exploration of adolescent love and innocence betrayed.

**You said:** This book captures the awkward tension and anxieties of the interwar period through a deeply reflective, but oddly naive, unloved girl. 

Heather O, Twitter  
 

**19\. [_Tess of the d'Urbervilles_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/55964/tess-of-the-d-urbervilles/9780141439594.html) by Thomas Hardy (1891)**

**We said:** It received mixed reviews it was first published, in part because it challenged Victorian ideals of purity and sexual morals. But [Thomas Hardy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/19650/thomas-hardy.html)’s unflinching account of Tess’s bid for salvation in a society ready to condemn her is a harrowing and powerful read.

**You said:** This novel teaches us about the position of women in the past and their moments of frailty versus moments of strength. Basically, an important insight for everyone to have!

Abbie H, Twitter  
 

**20\. [_Frankenstein_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/183673/frankenstein/9780141198965.html) by Mary Shelley (1823)**

**We said:** Written when [Mary Shelley](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/14754/mary-shelley.html) was just 18 years old, but don’t let that depress you. _Frankenstein_ is a Gothic masterpiece with entertaining set pieces aplenty.

**You said:** Chosen for all the questions it raises about consequences and taking responsibility for your actions; nature versus nurture; the value of friendship. I could go on.

Julie A, Twitter

**21\.  [_The Master and Margarita_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/35610/the-master-and-margarita/9780140455465.html) by Mikhail Bulgakov (1966)**

**We said:** This spine-chilling story was censored by Stalin and sadly only published after [Mikhail Bulgakov](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1011214/mikhail-bulgakov.html)’s death.

**You said:** This novel has got the Devil mooching around Moscow with a massive black cat. Oh, and there’s a naked flying lady.

Eggfrieddog, Twitter

**22\. [_The Go-Between_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/57119/the-go-between/9780141187785.html) by L. P. Hartley (1953)**

**We said:** A moving exploration by [L. P. Hartley](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/13255/l--p--hartley.html) of a young boy’s loss of innocence and a critical view of society at the end of the Victorian era.

**You said:** As a 17-year-old, I was completely absorbed by this story, wishing Leo was my brother so that I could protect him from the disappointment that awaited him.

Rapsodiafestiva, Twitter

**23\. [_One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/55626/one-flew-over-the-cuckoo-s-nest/9780141187884.html) by [Ken Kesey](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/13062/ken-kesey.html) (1962)**

**We said:** A psychiatric ward in Oregon is ruled by a tyrannical head nurse, but when a rebellious patient arrives her regime is thrown into disarray. A story of the imprisoned battling the establishment.

**You said:** A story that shows there is more to life than following rules. Having joy and being spontaneous are as important as anything else in life.

Darren B, Twitter 

**24\. [_Nineteen Eighty-Four_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1084996/nineteen-eighty-four/9781787302549.html) by George Orwell (1949)**

**We said:** The definitive dystopian novel, [George Orwell](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/9434/george-orwell.html)’s vision of a high surveillance society is gripping from the first page to the last. 

**You said:** I first read this book years ago, and was glad I would never have to be a part of that kind of society. Yet, here I am in 2018, and so much of that novel has come true.

Donna J, Twitter

**25\. [_Buddenbrooks_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1047773/buddenbrooks/9780749386474.html) by Thomas Mann (1901)**

**We said:** In [Thomas Mann](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1019212/thomas-mann.html)’s semi-autobiographical family epic, he portrays the slow decline of a wealthy and highly esteemed merchant-family in northern Germany over four generations, as they grapple with the modernism of the 20th century. 

**You said:** It’s a great novel about the rise and fall of a family, the relationship between fathers and sons, and the conflict between art and business. Well, and I have to say I do love family sagas.

Peter L, Twitter

**26\. [_The Grapes of Wrath_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/26143/the-grapes-of-wrath/9780141185064.html) by John Steinbeck (1939)**

**We said:** Perhaps [John Steinbeck](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/12246/john-steinbeck.html)’s finest novel, this is a beautifully evocative and, by the end, devastating read.

**You said:** Migration in search of work and a better future. A modern-day story. Still makes my skin tingle.

Morven, Twitter

**27\. [_Beloved_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1120144/beloved/9781529112832.html) by Toni Morrison (1987)**

**We said:** [Toni Morrison](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1008146/toni-morrison.html)'s novel tells the story of a former Kentucky slave haunted by the trauma of her past life, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988.

**You said:** This book is amazing. Beautifully written, haunting and the level of detail of the lengths people went to protect their families from slavery is fantastic.

LittleReigate, Twitter

**28\. _[The Code of the Woosters](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1074175/the-code-of-the-woosters/9781787461048.html)_ by P. G. Wodehouse (1938)**

**We said:** This is the third full-length novel featuring [P. G. Wodehouse](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/26933/p-g-wodehouse.html)’s best-known creations, the bumbling fool Bertie Wooster and his quick-thinking valet Jeeves. In this outing, the duo hatches a daring and hilarious scheme to steal an 18th-century cow-creamer. What could go wrong?

**You said:** The best of the Bertie and Jeeves novels by Wodehouse, the 20th century master of the light comic novel. Intricate plotting and brilliant command of English prose.

Matt F, Twitter

**29\. _[Dracula](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/183799/dracula/9780241256596.html)_ by Bram Stoker (1897)**

**We said:** [Bram Stoker](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/5772/bram-stoker.html)'s novel is told by multiple narrators in a series of diary entries, letters, newspaper articles and ships’ logs; an old folklore tale becomes a frightening reality for solicitor Jonathan Harker and his friends after he visits Count Dracula. And the Count is not a hero like our modern vampires aka Edward Cullen.

**You said:** A Gothic tale of fear and love. Would one desire immortality at the cost of one’s morality and soul? Loneliness beckons down such a dangerous and fearful path.

Rob K, Twitter

**30\. [_The Lord of the Rings_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1101146/the-lord-of-the-rings--the-trilogy/9780563528883.html) by J. R. R. Tolkien (1954)**

**We said:** Perhaps the greatest story ever told, [J. R. R. Tolkien](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1007187/j-r-r-tolkien.html)’s incredible trilogy of otherworldliness brought a world of hobbits, dwarves, elves and orcs to life in a way never read before. Ultimately a tale of companionship and the battle between good and evil, the fictional world of Middle Earth has endured to become far greater than the sum of its parts.

**You said:** It's got the great sweeping story, romance, heroism, self-sacrifice, social commentary... it's not just magic and elves!

Anne O, Twitter

**31\. [_The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/276485/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn/9780143107323.html) by Mark Twain (1884)**

**We said:** Meander down the Mississippi River with Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; on the surface, it’s a simple adventure but dig a little deeper into [Mark Twain](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1067329/mark-twain.html)'s novel and discover undercurrents of slavery, abuse and corruption in what Hemingway described as 'The best book we've had'.

**You said:** This book demonstrates how a young boy learns to think for himself, and shows us how we can, too. It’s funny, sweet and sad – sometimes all in the same paragraph.

Richard C, Twitter

**32\. [_Great Expectations_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/60338/great-expectations/9780141439563.html) by Charles Dickens (1860)**

**We said:** From the escaped convict lurking in the wild Kent marshes to the eccentric Miss Havisham who has remained in her wedding dress since the day she was jilted, orphan Pip’s coming of age story is one of [Charles Dickens](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/6331/charles-dickens.html)' most memorable and iconic novels.

**You said:** This book is not only important as a literary masterpiece and an evocative story - it also has universal appeal as, unfortunately, many children in today's world undergo the same suffering as Pip.

Ayesha K, Twitter 

**33\. [_Catch-22_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1036341/catch-22/9780099470465.html) by Joseph Heller (1961)**  

**We said:** The perfect read for a cacophonous political moment. [Joseph Heller](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1022487/joseph-heller.html)’s dizzying masterpiece brilliantly illustrates the way that power is hoarded and wielded like magic, with sleights of hand and rhetorical trickery deployed like weapons to leave normal people baffled and exhausted.

**You said:** In my opinion, there is no book that better captures human nature and the futility of conflict. You’ll come out the other side angry, uplifted, and crazy.

Sam W, Twitter

**34\. _[The Age of Innocence](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/17515/the-age-of-innocence/9780140189704.html)_ by Edith Wharton (1920)**

**We said:** A newlywed couple is shaken up by the arrival of the bride’s free-spirited and charismatic cousin Ellen, who piques the husband’s interests.

Whether it’s the greatest novel of the 20th century, or the most unreadable, is up for debate.

**We said:** Partly based on [Evelyn Waugh](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/8754/evelyn-waugh.html)’s personal experiences, _Scoop_ is a satirical take on the lengths reporters – and newspaper magnates – will go to for a story.

**We said:** _Diary of a Nobody_ follows a respectable middle-class man, Charles Pooter, and his attempts to live a respectable middle-class life.

**We said:** It was banned in the US and the UK for 30 years for being too ‘pornographic,’ and undoubtedly there are smutty moments, but [Henry Miller](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/10183/henry-miller.html) uses this to comment on the human condition. Told from a variety of first-person characters in 1930s Paris – including Miller’s own experiences as a struggling writer – the common thread between each character is their sexual encounters.

**We said:** Considered as [Somerset Maugham](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1043842/w--somerset-maugham.html)’s most autobiographical of his work, the author stated, ‘This is a novel, not an autobiography, though much in it is autobiographical, more is pure invention.’ Regardless, the story of Philip Carey, a man with ambitions who falls in love with a loud but irresistible waitress is considered one of his finest books.

**You said:** A compelling story of unreciprocated love.

**75\. [_Bleak House_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/60346/bleak-house/9780141439723.html) by Charles Dickens (1853)**

**We said:** At the centre of _Bleak House_ is the never-ending legal case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce which draws together a disparate group of people who hope in some way to profit from the case. Dickens’ scathing reflection of the legal profession went some way to support a judicial reform movement in the 1870s.

**You said:** An amazing story, with so many twists and turns

**76\. [_Lost Illusions_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/34907/lost-illusions/9780141936024.html) by Honoré de Balzac (1837)**

**We said:** Would-be poet Lucien Chardon moves from the French Provinces to the glamorous beau monde of Paris where he quickly discovers a world far more dangerous than he ever imagined. [Honoré de Balzac](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/10279/honore-de-balzac.html) paints a vivid and brutal picture of the hypocrisy and moral history of his times.

**You said:** A magnificent story about human nature, ambition and society (in any century).

**77\. [_Breakfast of Champions_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1038794/breakfast-of-champions/9780099842606.html) by Kurt Vonnegut (1973)**

**We said:** Part comedy, part searing satire, we’re taken to the Midwest to follow Vonnegut’s ageing writer Kilgore Trout on an absurd narrative. You may love it, you may not get the point. Either way, you’ll find it hard not to laugh.

**You said:** Reading this blend of surrealism, sci-fi and other genres made me realise that sometimes, fiction can be more powerful than real-life stories!

**78.  _[A Christmas Carol](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/280282/a-christmas-carol.html)_ by Charles Dickens (1843)**

**We said:** This is arguably Dickens’ most famous tale. Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim and exclamations of 'Bah Humbug!' are as synonymous with the festive seasons as Santa, turkey and Christmas pudding.

**You said:** A masterpiece. The ultimate story of hope and redemption.

**79\. [_Silas Marner_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/184001/silas-marner/9780141389455.html) by George Eliot (1861)**

**We said:** _Silas Marner_ was Eliot’s favourite of her novels. It tells the story of an isolated miser, who is given a second chance to transform his life when he adopts a young orphaned child. With themes of religion, industrialisation and community, the book also provides us with a glimpse of a vanished rural world.

**You said:** Redemption and love. Beautifully written

**80\. [_Mrs Dalloway_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1031695/mrs-dalloway/9780099470458.html) by [Virginia Woolf](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/21011/virginia-woolf.html) (1925)**

**We said:** One of literature’s most famous parties - this groundbreaking postmodernist novel centres around Clarria Dalloway’s preparations for a party she’s hosting, exploring themes of mental health, modernity and time.

**You said:** A reminder that no life is too small.

**We said:** In _Little Women_, [Louisa May Alcott](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1009586/louisa-may-alcott.html) set out to write a book in which girls would see them themselves accurately reflected. The March sisters, with their four very different personalities and ambitions, accurately embody both the challenges of growing up and the irreplaceable bond of sisterhood.

**You said:** A story of growing up and changing and the world set around a group of young girls. This book is as timeless as it is beautiful.

**82\. [_The Sea, The Sea_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1031499/the-sea--the-sea.html) by Iris Murdoch (1978)**

**We said:** Winner of the Man Booker Prize in 1978, [Iris Murdoch](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1006704/iris-murdoch.html)'s book is the story of strange obsessions and reflection which haunt Charles Arrowby, who retires from London’s glittering theatre world to an isolated home by the sea. An unforgettable story, beautifully told.

**You said:** This book left me speechless, while reading and after reading and I still can't find the words to describe why it is one of the most impressive pieces of writing I have ever read.

**83\. [_The Godfather_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1031422/the-godfather/9780099528128.html) by Mario Puzo (1969)  
**

**We said:** Both [Mario Puzo](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1019672/mario-puzo.html)'s book and 1972 film adaptation became global phenomena with this searing portrayal of New York’s Mafia underworld. A powerful story of tradition, blood, honour and of course, family allegiance.

**You said:** This novel teaches the reader about the strengths and failures of human nature.

**84\. [_The Castle_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/57104/the-castle/9780241197806.html) by Franz Kafka (1926)**

**We said:** Taking the word ‘Kafkaesque’ to new levels, _The Castle_ is a nightmarish reach into an autocratic world. Bamboozling from start to the very unfinished end (the novel ends mid-sentence), this is [Franz Kafka](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/9042/franz-kafka.html)’s finest commentary on oppression and bureaucracy.

**You said:** This book leads the reader into a maze of conundrums, confusion, iciness and moral fog. Never to be forgotten once read.

**85\. [_I, Claudius_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/57530/i--claudius/9780141188591.html) by Robert Graves (1934)**

**You said:** Written in the form of an autobiography of the Roman Emperor Claudius, [Robert Graves](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/21527/robert-graves.html)' novel captures the madness and debauchery of ancient Rome. Both _I, Claudius_ and Graves’s sequel _Claudius the God_ are regarded today as pioneering masterpieces of historical fiction, as well as gripping reads.  

**You said:** A beautifully written novel about absolute power. Very relevant.

**86\. [_Peter Pan_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/59642/peter-pan/9780141322575.html) by J.M. Barrie (1904)**

**You said:** The story that made every child want to dance on tiptoes over midnight rooftops and soar away to Neverland, [J. M. Barrie](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/31821/j-m-barrie.html)’s tale of the boy who could never grow up brought magic to bedtimes everywhere. From the Lost Boys to fearsome pirates, the enchanting adventure of _Peter Pan_ has, both literally and metaphorically, never grown old.

**You said:** A book that reminds everyone to never grow up inside!

**87\. [_A Confederacy of Dunces_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/57049/a-confederacy-of-dunces/9780141182865.html) by John Kennedy Toole (1980)**

**You said:** A medievalist protagonist encounters a series of misadventures in a comedic exploration of the human condition. [John Kennedy Toole](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/12277/john-kennedy-toole.html)'s novel is widely regarded today as a tragicomic classic that exposes 'intellectualism'.  

**You said:** I chose this book just because the characters are fantastic, and it makes me laugh.

**88\. [_The Razor's Edge_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1033416/the-razor-s-edge/9780099284864.html) by [W. Somerset Maugham](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1043842/w--somerset-maugham.html) (1944)**

**You said:** Featuring Maugham himself as a character and adapted twice for the big screen, _The Razor's Edge_ tells the story of an American pilot trying to adjust back to normal life following the First World War. It’s a gruelling look at the devastating effects of post-war trauma, and a philosophical journey to find meaning in life.

**You said:** A profound story of one man’s journey to find himself.

**89\. [_Lark Rise to Candleford_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/56565/lark-rise-to-candleford/9780141183312.html) by [Flora Thompson](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/56565/lark-rise-to-candleford/9780141183312.html) (1939)  
**  
**You said:** Many will remember the recent BBC series of the same name; _Lark Rise to Candleford_ is author Flora Thompson’s semi-autobiographical recollections of her youth and growing up in Oxfordshire, and paints a delightful portrait of country life at the end of the 19th century.

**You said:** Perhaps a little bit out of left field, but I love this book. It's simple, it's beautifully written and it's all about capturing a vanishing way of life as countryside farming turns to Victorian towns... really eloquent, really moving!

**90\. [_The Return of the Native_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1081792/return-of-the-native/9780099518983.html) by [Thomas Hardy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/54969/thomas-hardy.html) (1878)**

**We said:** When proud and passionate Eustacia Vye marries Clym Yeobright, she believes she can finally leave her rural life at Egdon Heath behind. But their unhappy marriage causes a chain of events culminating in tragedy, and their realisation that their destinies cannot be controlled.

**You said:** I chose this book because Eustacia Vye is misunderstood - as are many women.

**91\. [_A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/297598/a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man.html) by James Joyce (1916)**

**We said:** _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_ was [James Joyce](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/10941/james-joyce.html)’s first novel and details the young artist discovering his voice, craft and identity through his literary alter ego, Stephen Dedalus. There are echoes of his techniques here before they are refined in his later works such as _Ulysses_ and _Finnegans Wake_.

**You said:** Joyce is not only the greatest stylist in English, but the novel contains one of the most complex discussions of aesthetics in the 20th century.

**92\. [_Heart of Darkness_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1074030/heart-of-darkness/9780099511540.html) by Joseph Conrad (1902)**

**We said:** [Joseph Conrad](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/12439/joseph-conrad.html)’s novella has been deemed by many as a ‘difficult read’, but this enigmatic and atmospheric piece of fiction of Charles Marlow’s journey up the Congo river – which also provided the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola’s _Apocalypse Now_ – will leave you unfolding its many layers for a long time after. 

**You said:** What an amazing piece of writing from someone who had to learn the language first...

**93\. [_North and South_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1074039/north-and-south/9780099511489.html) by [Elizabeth Gaskell](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/8361/elizabeth-gaskell.html) (1854)**

**We said:** A swooningly romantic book with an exhilaratingly combative pairing at the centre. The themes of wealth and gender inequality are woven in seamlessly, and are completely integral to the electric dynamic between Margaret Hale and John Thornton.

**You said:** This novel combines a beautiful love story and discussion of important economical and social issues of its time.

**94\. [_The Handmaid's Tale_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1032806/the-handmaid-s-tale/9781784873189.html) by Margaret Atwood (1985)**

**We said:** ‘When it first came out it was viewed as being far-fetched,’ said [Margaret Atwood](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1022262/margaret-atwood.html) in 2017. The continued regression of abortion laws and women’s rights across the world has only made Atwood’s dystopian all the more pertinent; and ensuring the book – and TV show’s – place in history as a lynchpin of the feminist resistance.

**You said:** I chose this book because it gives a feminist perspective on the world. Also, Atwood uses events from history to create the story, which I find important. History is a circle.

**95\. [_Suite Francaise_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1036972/suite-francaise/9780099488781.html) by [Irene Nemirovsky](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1039472/irene-nemirovsky.html) (2004)**

**We said:** A novel of two halves, _Suite Francaise_ is about life and death in occupied France, and finding love and hope in the most unexpected of places.

**You said:** This is my favourite book. It is an extremely moving account of the kinds of things that actually happened in Nazi-occupied France during the Second World War. It presents the dilemmas, fears and choices that were felt and had to be made by ordinary people.

Jim H, Twitter

**96\. [_One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1032669/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich/9780099449270.html) by [Alexander Solzhenitsyn](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1021095/aleksandr-solzhenitsyn.html) (1962)**

**We said:** This deeply personal and unforgettable account of a day in the life at a Soviet labour camp in the 1950s is highly considered to be one of the greats of contemporary literature.

**You said:** Solzhenitsyn’s writing from personal experience of life/existence in a forced labour camp under Stalin's communist regime is a stark, brutal, masterpiece.

**97\. [_What A Carve Up!_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/61079/what-a-carve-up-.html) by [Jonathan Coe](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/21695/jonathan-coe.html) (1994)**

**We said:** The Winshaw family are the most powerful and cruellest family in England that is until their biographer Michael Owen starts investigating the family’s corrupt and immoral activities. A dark and wickedly funny story which makes a profound statement on the Thatcherite era.

**You said:** This novel has so much to say about human nature, political power and the elite, and always will do. Caustic, heartfelt, funny, devastating; a beautiful book.

Declan C, Twitter

**98\. [_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1038662/zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance/9780099786405.html) by [Robert Pirsig](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/1006731/robert-pirsig.html) (1974)**

**We said:** Anyone looking for an introduction to philosophy need look no further. It’s also a touching portrayal of fatherhood and friendship.

**You said:** An amazing philosophical adventure that influenced a generation.

**99\. [_White Nights_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/292382/white-nights/9780241252086.html) by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1848)**  

**We said:** One of [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/9133/fyodor-dostoyevsky.html)'s underrated works, this short story is divided into six sections. With themes of loneliness and unrequited love told by a nameless narrator – it’s quintessential Dostoyevsky.

**You said:** This is an incredibly beautiful and uplifting book. Everyone should read it!

**100\. [_Hard Times_](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/books/1115059/hard-times--vintage-classics-dickens-series-/9781784873431.html) by [Charles Dickens](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/authors/6331/charles-dickens.html) (1854)**

**We said:** Dickens uses the fictional town of Coketown and its inhabitants to explore the harsh realities of the Industrial Age and the importance of imagination in a world driven by fact.

**You said:** Pathos, humour, social comment, politic and incredibly well-drawn, believable characters_._
