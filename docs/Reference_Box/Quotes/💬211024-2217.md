## Notes:
> “My history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, and is very particular and very horrible. Their the Jesuit Order’s restoration in 1814 by Pope Pius VII is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, despotism, and death. … I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of Ignatius de Loyola.”
