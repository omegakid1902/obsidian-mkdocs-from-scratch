## Notes:
> "There are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like"

> Chúng ta dùng tiền mà chúng ta không có, để mua những thứ chúng ta không cần, nhằm gây ấn tượng với những người chúng ta không thích!
