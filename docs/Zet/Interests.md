# Interests 

### Knowledge Management
The [[PKM MOC]] shows the best practices of [[Knowledge Management]]. I use the [[LYT Kit]] to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [[MOC - Map Of Content|MOC]] is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer.

### Personal Management
The [[Mindsets MOC]] can galvanize my attention; the [[Concepts MOC]] can flavor it; and the [[Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. 

Others: [[Posture MOC]] and [[Hormesis MOC]] and [[Breathing Exercises MOC]]. [[S√°ch ƒë√£ ƒë·ªçc]]

## Commentary
### Choosing your Classification System
In case you were wondering, the above structure is based heavily on the Cutter and Universal Decimal classification systems. When in doubt, it's a wise move to use a pre-built, time-tested foundation to structure the interests of your digital library.

I wouldn't go overboard with numbering things. We‚Äôre just using a basic pre-made map as a fixed *spatial constellation* upon which to easily add dots of new interests.[^1] 

#### The structure of this classification system
- The Self
	- 000 [[Home|Knowledge Management]]
	- 100 Personal Management
	- 200 Philosophy & Psychology; Spirituality & Religion
- Others
	- 300 Social Sciences
	- 400 Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics
- Others + Self
	- 500 Natural Sciences
	- 600 Applied Sciences
	- 700 Art & Recreation
	- 800 Literature
- History of Others & Self
	- 900 History & Biography & Geography

### Other structures
There are other structures to consider. Depending on your classification needs, you may prefer more granularity, or less. Bri M. Watson (Masters in Library Science (MLIS), PhD in "Information") will have something to show us shortly. Or you could go another direction and consider [The Donut of Knowledge](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1846/29852456427_d59d142757_b.jpg), which is fun, but it may not work as neatly. 


### Commentary on an A-Z list of MOCs
For those that want to maintain an alphabetical "Map of Maps" list, here's an incomplete example of the MOCs from above. It's incomplete, and actually no longer perfectly alphabetical since I've changed some of the names...which is why you should just use #MOC for your alphabetical list instead.

- [[PKM MOC]] - Managing my Personal Knowledge
- [[Greco-Roman MOC]] - Greek, Roman
- [[Art MOC]]
- [[Confucianism MOC]]
- [[Cooking MOC]]
- [[Cosmology MOC]]
- [[Football MOC]]
- [[L·ªãch s·ª≠]]
- [[Home Building MOC]]
- [[Language]]
	- [[Chinese Language MOC]]
	- [[English Language MOC]]
	- [[French Language MOC]]
	- [[Latin Language MOC]]
- [[VƒÉn h·ªçc]]
- [[Rhetoric MOC]]
- [[Stoicism - Ch·ªß nghƒ©a kh·∫Øc k·ª∑]]
- [[Vocals MOC]]
- [[Words MOC]]
