![[FBI vault.png]]

Tài liệu được [[FBI]] công bố gồm 3 phần, trong đó có một đoạn trong [phần 3](https://vault.fbi.gov/nikola-tesla/Nikola%20Tesla%20Part%2003%20of%2003/view) có nói rằng:


> Margaret Storm has been assigned to certain work with the Space People, she is writing a book – Return of the Dove – a story of the life of Nikola Tesla, scientist, and the part his inventions will play in the New Age. Much of the data for this book has been supplied to Mrs. Storm through transcripts received on the Tesla set, a radio-type machine invented by Tesla in 1938 for Interplanetary Communication. Tesla died in 1943 and his engineers did not build the Tesla set until after his death. It was placed in operation in 1950 and since that time the Tesla engineers have been in close touch with space ships. The Space People have visited the Tesla engineers many times, and have told us that Tesla was a Venusian, brought to this planet as a baby, in 1856, and left with Mr. and Mrs. Tesla in a remote mountain province in what is now Yogoslavia.

## Ideas & thoughts:
- Kiểm tra tính xác thực của thông tin [[FBI]] công bố.
- Vậy là người ngoài hành tinh là có thật, và họ sống ngay trong hệ mặt trời?
- Các lời nói của Tesla về cội nguồn tri thức có đúng không?
- [[Akashic records]]
- Một dạng sống vượt qua thể xác vật lý có tồn tại, [[Linh hồn]] có tồn tại?
